github code for a demo: https://github.com/ethanmick/next-auth-with-prisma
Adapters are database-specific components that handle the translation of Prisma Client queries to actual database queries.
Generators, on the other hand, are responsible for generating the code for Prisma Client (a type-safe database client tailored
to your data model.) based on your data model specified inthe Prisma Schema. The combination of an adapter and a Prisma Client
generated by the generator allows you to interact with your chosen database in a type-safe manner.

- To install adapter - npm i next-auth@latest @next-auth/prisma-adapter
- for toast - npm install react-toast-notifications
